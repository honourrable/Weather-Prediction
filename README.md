# Weather-Prediction

In this study, weather forecast operation was performed by using machine learning algorithms. First, machine learning methods were trained by using a dataset which was got from kaggle.com and then the system was tested with real data that come from sensors such as DHT11, BMP180. These sensors produce temperature, pressure and humidity real time data.

### The System
