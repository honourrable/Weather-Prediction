# Weather-Prediction

In this study, weather forecast operation was performed by using machine learning algorithms. First, machine learning methods were trained by using a dataset which was got from kaggle.com and then the system was tested with real data that come from sensors such as DHT11, BMP180. These sensors produce temperature, pressure and humidity real time data.

### The System

In the system, the following components were used to perform the the task:

- A DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity
- A BMP180 for air pressure
- A 16x2 LCD Display to print the prediction for the user
- A buzzer and led to signal when the specific condition hits (in this case rainy output)

### Output and Success

The program output and the system's success details were mentioned below.
